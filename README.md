# Hipatia

Hipatia is an open source project created to expose different programming resources that can be used in several solutions and algorithms.
This project wants to be a compendium of data structures and algorithms, from classical to quantum computing that can be generic and reusable by anyone.

The idea is to generate high-level implementations of the algorithms and data structures in Python and optimize certain funcionality in C++.
